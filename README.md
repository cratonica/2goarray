# 2gobytes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paulvollmer/2gobytes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paulvollmer/2gobytes)

A simple utility to encode a file (or any other data) into a Go byte slice.

Having [set up your Go environment](http://golang.org/doc/install), simply run
```
go get github.com/paulvollmer/2gobytes
```

Then use by piping a file into the utility and capturing the output.
You must provide a name for the generated slice symbol and package name. For example:

```
$GOPATH/bin/2gobytes -p mypackage -a MyArray < myimage.png > myimage.go
```

This will output something like:
```
package mypackage

var MyArray []byte = []byte {
  0x49, 0x20, 0x63, 0x61, 0x6e, 0x27, 0x74, 0x20, 0x62, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x69,
  0x65, 0x76, 0x65, 0x20, 0x79, 0x6f, 0x75, 0x20, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0x75,
  0x61, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x79, 0x20, 0x64, 0x65, 0x63, 0x6f, 0x64, 0x65, 0x64,
  0x20, 0x74, 0x68, 0x69, 0x73, 0x2e, 0x20, 0x4b, 0x75, 0x64, 0x6f, 0x73,
  0x20, 0x66, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x20, 0x62, 0x65, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x67, 0x20, 0x74,
  0x68, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x75, 0x67, 0x68, 0x2e, 0x0a,
}
```
